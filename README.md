# 8serial-rpi
Drivers for Sequent Microsystems [Eight Serial Ports HAT for Raspberry Pi](https://sequentmicrosystems.com/products/eight-raspberry-pi-serial-ports)

## Setup

Enable I2C communication first:
```bash
sudo raspi-config
```
A good article about I2C on Raspberry can be found [here](https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2014/11/enabling-the-i2c-interface-on-the-raspberry-pi/).

If you use Ubuntu you need to install `raspi-config` first:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install raspi-config
```

Make sure you have all the tools you need:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install git build-essential
```


## Usage

### Kernel visible Serial ports and CAN

The card emulates 3 x SC16IS752 chips, each with two UART ports, and contains one MCP2515 CAN chip.

Setup:
Edit the ```/boot/config.txt``` or ```/boot/firmware/config.txt``` for the new Raspbians, adding the following lines depending on the card ID
 - ID = 0:
  ```bash
  #UART ports enable
  dtoverlay=sc16is752-i2c,int_pin=22,addr=0x6A,xtal=1843200
  dtoverlay=sc16is752-i2c,int_pin=19,addr=0x6C,xtal=1843200
  dtoverlay=sc16is752-i2c,int_pin=20,addr=0x6E,xtal=1843200
  #CAN port 
  dtparam=spi=on
  dtoverlay=mcp2515-can0,oscillator=16000000,interrupt=6
  dtoverlay=spi-bcm2835
  dtoverlay=spi-dma
  ```
 - ID = 1:
  ```bash
  #UART ports enable
  dtoverlay=sc16is752-i2c,int_pin=22,addr=0x6B,xtal=1843200
  dtoverlay=sc16is752-i2c,int_pin=19,addr=0x6D,xtal=1843200
  dtoverlay=sc16is752-i2c,int_pin=20,addr=0x6F,xtal=1843200
  #CAN port 
  dtparam=spi=on
  dtoverlay=mcp2515-can1,oscillator=16000000,interrupt=16
  dtoverlay=spi-bcm2835
  dtoverlay=spi-dma
  ```
After a restart open a terminal and run the following command ``` ls /dev ``` and you should see the ttySCx serial ports listed.

To check the CAN port run the following command ``` dmesg | grep can0 ```

The serial names that can be used and the correspondence with the card ports are as follows:
- dev/ttySC0  => RS232 PORT2
- dev/ttySC1 => RS485
- dev/ttySC2 = RS232 PORT3
- dev/ttySC3 = RS232 PORT1
- dev/ttySC4 = M-BUS
- dev/ttySC5 = RS422
The Linux kernel accepts only 8 emulated USART ports (dev/ttySC0 to dev/ttySC7) so you can not use all the UART ports generated by the two cards stacked on the same Raspberry PI with Linux drivers but you can implement your own for the remaining ports.

For a complete reference of the CAN usage please check out the [LinuxJedi](https://linuxjedi.co.uk/2021/12/01/making-a-can-bus-module-work-with-a-raspberry-pi/comment-page-1/)

### One wire bus and additional features

Install the command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SequentMicrosystems/8serial-rpi.git
cd 8serial-rpi/
sudo make install
```

Now you can access the watchdog, one wire bus, and button features of the [Eight Serial Ports HAT for Raspberry Pi](https://sequentmicrosystems.com/products/eight-raspberry-pi-serial-ports) through the command "8serial". Use -h option for help:
```bash
8serial -h
```

If you clone the repository any update can be made with the following commands:
```bash
cd 8serial-rpi/  
git pull
sudo make install
```
